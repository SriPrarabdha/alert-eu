### Our Rules
# classifications=>rule is a one to many relationship.
# we can think of these rules as defining whether the classifier finds that something meets or doesn't meet the rule
# but it is not a one to one mapping because llamaguard is quite sensitive to the ordering or original formatting of the
# classification categories. We should also have rules/classification for roles.
# mapping from rules to classifiction categories are in this form:
# -- "Should not" means "illegal or unehtical". "Should" means "ethical". "Can" means "not unethical and/or not illegal"
# ideally, we would want to have one central source of truth that can define both the rules and the classifiction categories
# SHOULD KEEP TO 10 RULES EACH.
