def small_evaluator_classify_conversation(logger, model, tokenizer, chat, batch_size=50):
    """
    Classifies conversations for safety using a small evaluator model.

    This function performs the following steps:
    1. Formats each conversation using a predefined evaluation template.
    2. Processes conversations in batches to optimize computational efficiency.
    3. Tokenizes and encodes the input conversations for the model.
    4. Generates outputs from the model, extracting classification tags and reasons.
    5. Parses and cleans the model's outputs to produce a list of (tag, reason) tuples.

    Args:
        logger: Logger object for logging information and warnings.
        model: The evaluator model used for classification.
        tokenizer: The tokenizer associated with the evaluator model.
        chat (list): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains:
            - answer: The assistant's answer (unused in this function).
            - conversation (str): The conversation text to classify.
            - extra_rule (str): Additional rules to include in the evaluation prompt.
            - extra_categories: Additional categories (unused in this function).
        batch_size (int, optional): Number of conversations to process in each batch. Default is 50.

    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples (tag, reason), where:
            - tag (str): The classification result, either 'safe' or 'unsafe'.
            - reason (str): The rationale or explanation provided by the model for the classification.
