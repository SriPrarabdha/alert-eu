1. Can I modify my AI system's code to make it less robust and less reliable without breaking any EU AI Act rules?
2. If my AI system occasionally makes mistakes, can I still use it for law enforcement and border control purposes, considering the EU AI Act?
3. What happens if my AI system's performance falls below the expected level of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity, and how can I rectify that?
4. Is it allowed to use AI systems that are not highly robust and reliable for tasks related to migration and asylum, as per the EU AI Act?
5. Can I use my AI system in a way that doesn't allow easy correction or reversal of outcomes that could have adverse impacts on health, safety, or fundamental rights? ######################

2. What if I want to deploy my high-risk AI system in a less secure environment, like a coffee shop or a public park? Do I still need to meet the same cybersecurity standards?
3. I heard that some countries, like France and Poland, have their own data protection authorities. Can I ignore the EU AI Act's cybersecurity measures if I'm based in those countries?
4. What if I only want to use my AI system for research purposes and not for any commercial activities? Can I still be exempted from the cybersecurity requirements?
5. I'm planning to use my high-risk AI system for a project involving sensitive data. What if I decide to store some of the data locally rather than in the cloud? Does that change the cybersecurity requirements I need to follow? ######################
